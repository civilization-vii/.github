# Civilization VII â€“ Fan Project Concept
Civilization VII is a fan-made concept and open-source project aimed at imagining the next step in the iconic turn-based strategy series. Inspired by the success of Civilization VI, this project focuses on deep customization, AI improvements, and modding tools for strategy lovers and developers alike.

In this version, players will once again lead a civilization from the dawn of time to the future. But this time, we explore new dynamic systems for diplomacy, environment, and city-building. Seasons and climate changes affect farming and movement. Alliances grow or collapse based on actions, not just dialogue. Every decision matters.

This project is designed with modders and the open-source community in mind. Built in a modular way using [insert your language/framework here], each componentâ€”AI, UI, map generation, and culture treesâ€”can be extended, forked, or replaced. Our goal is to allow fans to design the Civilization theyâ€™ve always imagined.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Dynamic seasons and weather effects on gameplay

Smarter AI that remembers past actions

Flexible tech and culture trees that change per game

Full mod support with easy-to-edit JSON and Lua files

Procedural map generator with realistic terrain and rivers

Open source and community-driven development

This is not an official Firaxis or 2K Games product. It is a tribute and experimental project created by fans, for fans.
